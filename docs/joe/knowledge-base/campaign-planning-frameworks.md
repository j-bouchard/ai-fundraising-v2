## Goal Setting Methodologies

### Top-Down Analysis

**Formula: Historical Performance × Growth Multiple**

```
Past 3-Year Average Annual Giving = $X
× Campaign Multiple (typically 3-5x)
= Preliminary Campaign Goal
```

**Adjustment Factors:**
- Economic conditions (±20%)
- Competitive landscape (±15%)
- Organizational trajectory (±10%)
- Leadership strength (±10%)

### Bottom-Up Analysis

**Formula: Sum of Identified Prospects at Ask Levels**

```
Prospect Research Total:
- 1 prospect at $5M = $5M
- 3 prospects at $1M = $3M
- 10 prospects at $500K = $5M
- 25 prospects at $100K = $2.5M
- 100 prospects at $25K = $2.5M
= Total Identified: $18M

× Realization Rate (typically 65-75%)
= Achievable Goal: $11.7-13.5M
```

### Hybrid Model (Recommended)

**Step 1:** Calculate top-down estimate
**Step 2:** Build bottom-up prospect model
**Step 3:** Reconcile differences
**Step 4:** Stress test with gift chart
**Step 5:** Set stretch and minimum goals

**Goal Framework:**
- **Minimum Goal:** 80% of calculated target
- **Public Goal:** 90-95% of calculated target
- **Working Goal:** 100% of calculated target
- **Stretch Goal:** 110-120% of calculated target

## Gift Range Chart Construction

### Standard Gift Range Chart Formula

**Traditional Rule of Thirds:**
- Top 10 gifts = 33% of goal
- Next 100 gifts = 33% of goal
- All remaining gifts = 34% of goal

### Modern Gift Range Chart Template

**For $10 Million Campaign:**

| Gift Range | # Gifts | # Prospects | Subtotal | Cumulative % |
|------------|---------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| $2,000,000 | 1 | 4 | $2,000,000 | 20% |
| $1,000,000 | 2 | 8 | $2,000,000 | 40% |
| $500,000 | 4 | 16 | $2,000,000 | 60% |
| $250,000 | 6 | 24 | $1,500,000 | 75% |
| $100,000 | 10 | 40 | $1,000,000 | 85% |
| $50,000 | 15 | 60 | $750,000 | 92.5% |
| $25,000 | 25 | 100 | $625,000 | 98.75% |
| <$25,000 | Many | Many | $125,000 | 100% |
| **Total** | **63+** | **252+** | **$10,000,000** | **100%** |

### Prospect-to-Ask Ratios by Level

**Lead Gifts ($1M+):** 4:1 ratio
**Major Gifts ($100K-$999K):** 4:1 ratio
**Special Gifts ($25K-$99K):** 3:1 ratio
**General Gifts (<$25K):** 2:1 ratio

### Gift Chart Validation Tests

**Test 1: Top Gift Reality Check**
- Lead gift should be 10-20% of goal
- If >25%, goal may be too aggressive
- If <10%, may indicate capacity exists for higher goal

**Test 2: Prospect Pool Depth**
- Must identify 3-4x prospects than gifts needed
- Verify actual names at top levels
- Confirm cultivation stage of prospects

**Test 3: Historical Performance**
- Compare to previous campaign charts
- Benchmark against peer organizations
- Adjust for organizational growth
