# Major Gift Solicitation Best Practices Guide

## Defining Major Gifts by Organization Size

Major gifts are relative to your organization's budget and donor base. Here's a practical framework:

### Organization Size Tiers

**Small Organizations ($500K-$1M annual budget)**
- Major gift threshold: $1,000+
- Transformational gift: $10,000+
- Top 20 donors typically represent 60-70% of individual giving

**Mid-Size Organizations ($1M-$10M annual budget)**
- Major gift threshold: $5,000+
- Transformational gift: $50,000+
- Top 20 donors typically represent 50-60% of individual giving

**Large Organizations ($10M-$50M annual budget)**
- Major gift threshold: $25,000+
- Transformational gift: $250,000+
- Top 20 donors typically represent 40-50% of individual giving

**Major Institutions ($50M+ annual budget)**
- Major gift threshold: $100,000+
- Transformational gift: $1M+
- Top 20 donors typically represent 30-40% of individual giving

### Dynamic Definition Formula
Calculate your major gift threshold: **(Total Individual Giving ÷ Number of Donors) × 10**

This ensures your major gift level represents approximately the top 3-5% of your donor base.

## Ask Amount Formulas

### Formula 1: Historical Upgrade Method
**Previous Largest Gift × 2-3 = Ask Amount**

Use multiplier based on:
- 2x for donors giving regularly
- 2.5x for donors with increased capacity
- 3x for campaign or special initiative

### Formula 2: Capacity-Based Method
**(Estimated Net Worth × 0.005) = Annual Ask**
**(Estimated Net Worth × 0.05) = Campaign Ask**

Adjust based on:
- Liquidity (reduce by 25-50% for illiquid wealth)
- Philanthropic priority (increase by 25% if you're top 3 charity)
- Timing (reduce by 30% if recently made major gift elsewhere)

### Formula 3: Peer Comparison Method
**Average of Top 3 Comparable Donors' Gifts × 1.2 = Ask Amount**

Comparable factors:
- Similar wealth level
- Same industry/profession
- Similar age/life stage
- Comparable giving history

### Formula 4: Project-Based Method
**(Total Project Cost ÷ Number of Lead Donors) = Ask Amount**

Typically structure as:
- 1 donor at 20-25% of goal
- 2-3 donors at 10-15% of goal
- 4-6 donors at 5-10% of goal
- 8-12 donors at 2-5% of goal

## Objection Handling Scripts

**Response:** "Of course, this is exactly the kind of decision that should involve your [spouse/advisor]. Would it be helpful if I joined that conversation to answer any questions, or would you prefer I prepare additional materials for you to share with them?"

### "I'm not ready to commit right now"
**Response:** "I understand completely. Timing is important for a gift of this significance. When might be a better time to revisit this conversation? In the meantime, are there other ways you'd like to stay engaged with our work?"

### "I support other organizations"
**Response:** "That's wonderful—it speaks to your generous spirit and commitment to making a difference. I'm curious, what draws you to those organizations?
