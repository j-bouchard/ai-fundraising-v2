## Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

### Cost Per Dollar Raised (CPDR) by Channel

**Direct Mail Costs:**

```
Components:
- List rental/selection: $0.05-0.15/name
- Creative development: $2,000-5,000
- Printing: $0.50-1.00/piece
- Postage: $0.35-0.65/piece
- Processing: $0.10-0.20/piece
- Total: $1.00-2.00/piece

CPDR Calculation:
$2,000 cost ÷ $10,000 raised = $0.20 CPDR
```

**Email Costs:**

```
Components:
- Platform fee: $100-500/month
- Design/content: $500-1,000/campaign
- List management: $0.01/contact
- Total: $0.02-0.05/email

CPDR Calculation:
$200 cost ÷ $5,000 raised = $0.04 CPDR
```

**Phone Costs:**

```
Components:
- Caller wages: $15-20/hour
- Training: $500/caller
- Phone/systems: $50/month/caller
- Scripts/materials: $500
- Total: $10-15/completed call

CPDR Calculation:
$3,000 cost ÷ $12,000 raised = $0.25 CPDR
```

**Digital Costs:**

```
Components:
- Ad spend: Variable
- Creative development: $1,000-3,000
- Platform management: $500-1,500/month
- Landing pages: $500-1,000
- Total: Depends on spend

CPDR Calculation:
$5,000 cost ÷ $15,000 raised = $0.33 CPDR
```

### ROI Analysis Framework

**Lifetime Value Calculation:**

```
LTV = (Average Gift × Frequency × Retention Years) - Acquisition Cost

Example:
($150 avg × 1.5 gifts/year × 5 years) - $50 acquisition = $1,075 LTV
```

**Break-Even Analysis:**

```
Break-Even Point = Fixed Costs ÷ (Revenue per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)

Example:
$10,000 fixed ÷ ($100 avg gift - $20 cost) = 125 donors needed
```

### Budget Allocation Model

**Optimal Channel Mix (% of budget):**

| Channel | Acquisition | Retention | Upgrade |
|---------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Direct Mail | 40% | 35% | 30% |
| Email | 10% | 25% | 20% |
| Phone | 15% | 20% | 30% |
