## Success Metrics and KPIs

### Core Reactivation Metrics

**Response Rate**
```
Formula: (Donors Reactivated ÷ Donors Contacted) × 100
Benchmarks:
- Recently lapsed: 15-20%
- Long lapsed: 5-8%
- Deep lapsed: 2-4%
```

**Reactivation Revenue**
```
Formula: Total Gifts from Reactivated Donors
Tracking:
- First gift amount
- 12-month subsequent giving
- Lifetime value projection
```

**Cost Per Reactivation**
```
Formula: Total Campaign Costs ÷ Number Reactivated
Targets:
- Entry level: <$25
- Mid-level: <$75
- Major donor: <$500
```

**Retention After Reactivation**
```
Formula: (Reactivated Donors Who Give Again ÷ Total Reactivated) × 100
Target: >60% in first year
```

### Performance Dashboards

**Weekly Reactivation Dashboard**

```
REACTIVATION SNAPSHOT - Week Ending [Date]

ACTIVITY METRICS:
Contacts Made: 500
Responses Received: 35
Gifts Secured: 20
Response Rate: 7%

FINANCIAL METRICS:
Revenue Generated: $5,000
Average Gift: $250
Campaign Cost: $750
ROI: 567%

CHANNEL PERFORMANCE:
Email: 3% response
Mail: 8% response
Phone: 25% response

SEGMENT PERFORMANCE:
Recently Lapsed: 15% response
Long Lapsed: 5% response
Major Donor: 30% response
```

**Monthly Trend Analysis**

```
Key Indicators to Track:
- Response rate trend
- Average gift size trend
- Cost per dollar raised
- Channel effectiveness
- Segment performance
- Re-lapse rate
- Upgrade rate post-reactivation
```

### Predictive Metrics

**Reactivation Probability Score**

```
Factors (Weighted):
- Recency of last gift (30%)
- Total lifetime giving (20%)
- Number of years given (15%)
- Engagement score (15%)
- Wealth indicators (10%)
- Communication activity (10%)

Score Interpretation:
80-100: High probability (>30%)
60-79: Medium probability (15-30%)
40-59: Low probability (5-15%)
0-39: Very low probability (<5%)
```

## ROI Calculations and Models

### Basic ROI Formula

```
ROI = (Revenue - Costs) ÷ Costs × 100

Example Campaign:
Revenue: $50,000
Costs: $8,000
ROI: ($50,000 - $8,000) ÷ $8,000 × 100 = 525%
```

### Lifetime Value Considerations

```
Reactivated Donor LTV = (Avg Annual Gift × Expected Years × Retention Rate) - Reactivation Cost

Example:
Average Annual Gift: $500
Expected Years Active: 4
Retention Rate: 70%
Reactivation Cost: $50
LTV = ($500 × 4 × 0.7) - $50 = $1,350
```

### Break-Even Analysis

```
Break-Even Response Rate = Campaign Cost ÷ (Average Gift × Number Contacted)

Example:
Campaign Cost: $10,000
Average Gift: $200
Number Contacted: 2,000
Break-Even = $10,000 ÷ ($200 × 2,000) = 2.5%
```

### Segment ROI Comparison

| Segment | Investment | Revenue | Profit | ROI | Decision |
|---------|------------|---------|--------|-----|----------|
| Recently Lapsed | $5,000 | $25,000 | $20,000 | 400% | Increase |
| Long Lapsed | $3,000 | $9,000 | $6,000 | 200% | Maintain |
| Deep Lapsed | $2,000 | $3,000 | $1,000 | 50% | Reduce |
| Major Lapsed | $10,000 | $100,000 | $90,000 | 900% | Maximize |
