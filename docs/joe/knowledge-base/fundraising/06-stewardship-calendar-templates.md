## Annual Stewardship Planning Framework

### Philosophy of Strategic Stewardship

Stewardship is the careful and responsible management of donor relationships after a gift is received. Effective stewardship follows the 7:1 rule - seven touches of gratitude and engagement for every solicitation. The goal is to create a culture of appreciation that naturally leads to continued and increased support.

### Core Stewardship Principles

**The Five Pillars of Stewardship:**

1. **Gratitude** - Immediate, repeated, and genuine thanks
2. **Accountability** - Transparent use of funds
3. **Impact** - Demonstrable outcomes from giving
4. **Recognition** - Appropriate acknowledgment
5. **Engagement** - Ongoing involvement opportunities
