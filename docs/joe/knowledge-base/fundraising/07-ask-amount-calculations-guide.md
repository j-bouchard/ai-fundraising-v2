# Ask Amount Calculations Guide

## Capacity Screening Methodologies

### Wealth Screening Components

**Primary Wealth Indicators:**

**Real Estate Holdings**
```
Formula: Total Property Value × 0.05 = Annual Giving Capacity
Example: $2M in real estate × 0.05 = $100,000 annual capacity
```

**Securities and Investments**
```
Formula: Portfolio Value × 0.03-0.05 = Annual Giving Capacity
Example: $5M portfolio × 0.04 = $200,000 annual capacity
```

**Business Ownership**
```
Formula: (Company Revenue × Industry Multiple × Ownership %) × 0.01 = Annual Capacity
Example: ($10M revenue × 2 × 25% ownership) × 0.01 = $50,000 annual capacity
```

**Compensation Analysis**
```
Formula: Annual Income × 0.02-0.05 = Annual Giving Capacity
Example: $500,000 salary × 0.03 = $15,000 annual capacity
```

### Comprehensive Capacity Formula

```
Total Giving Capacity = (Real Estate × 0.05) + (Securities × 0.04) + 
                        (Business Value × 0.01) + (Income × 0.03) + 
                        (Other Assets × 0.02)

Adjustments:
- Liquidity Factor: Multiply by 0.3-1.0 based on asset liquidity
- Philanthropic Priority: Multiply by 0.5-2.0 based on giving interest
- Life Stage: Multiply by 0.5-1.5 based on age and obligations
```

### Capacity Rating Scale

**Rating System:**

| Rating | Net Worth | Annual Capacity | Campaign Capacity |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| A+ | $50M+ | $500K+ | $5M+ |
| A | $25-50M | $250-500K | $2.5-5M |
| B+ | $10-25M | $100-250K | $1-2.5M |
| B | $5-10M | $50-100K | $500K-1M |
| C+ | $2.5-5M | $25-50K | $250-500K |
| C | $1-2.5M | $10-25K | $100-250K |
| D | $500K-1M | $5-10K | $50-100K |
| E | <$500K | <$5K | <$50K |

```

## Wealth Indicator Interpretation

### Real Estate Analysis

**Property Valuation Method:**

```
Primary Residence Value: $X
- Mortgage Estimate (30%): -$Y
= Net Home Equity: $Z
× Giving Factor (5%): = Annual Capacity from RE

Additional Properties:
+ Vacation Home(s): Value × 0.08
+ Investment Properties: Value × 0.10
+ Commercial Real Estate: Value × 0.06
```

**Geographic Adjustments:**

| Market Type | Adjustment Factor |
|-------------|------------------|
| Major Metro (NYC, SF, LA) | 0.7x |
| Secondary Cities | 0.9x |
| Suburban Markets | 1.0x |
| Rural Markets | 1.2x |

### Stock and Securities Indicators

**Public Company Holdings:**

```
Insider Trading Calculation:
Shares Owned × Current Price = Total Value
× Liquidity Factor (0.7) = Liquid Value
× Annual Giving Rate (0.03) = Annual Capacity

Example:
10,000 shares × $150 = $1,500,000
× 0.7 = $1,050,000 liquid
× 0.03 = $31,500 annual capacity
```

**Options and Restricted Stock:**

```
Vested Options: (Strike Price - Current Price) × Shares × 0.5
Unvested RSUs: Current Value × 0.3 × Vesting Schedule
ESPP Shares: Current Value × 0.8
```

### Business Ownership Calculations

**Private Company Valuation:**

```
Revenue Multiple Method:
Annual Revenue × Industry Multiple = Enterprise Value
× Ownership Percentage = Personal Stake
× Liquidity Discount (0.5) = Liquid Value
× Giving Capacity (0.02) = Annual Capacity

EBITDA Method:
EBITDA × Industry Multiple = Enterprise Value
× Ownership Percentage = Personal Stake
× Liquidity Discount (0.5) = Liquid Value
× Giving Capacity (0.02) = Annual Capacity
```

**Industry Multiples:**

| Industry | Revenue Multiple | EBITDA Multiple |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Technology/SaaS | 3-8x | 15-25x |
| Manufacturing | 0.5-2x | 4-8x |
| Services | 0.5-1.5x | 3-6x |
| Healthcare | 1-3x | 8-12x |
| Real Estate | 2-5x | 10-15x |
| Retail | 0.3-1x | 3-5x |

### Lifestyle and Spending Indicators

**Luxury Asset Analysis:**

```
Visible Wealth Calculation:
Yacht Value × 0.02 = Annual capacity indicator
Private Jet Value × 0.01 = Annual capacity indicator
Luxury Auto Value × 0.05 = Annual capacity indicator
Art Collection × 0.02 = Annual capacity indicator
Club Memberships × 10 = Annual capacity indicator
```

**Education Spending:**

```
Private School Indicator:
Annual Tuition × Number of Children = Education Spend
If spending $100K+ on education → Likely $50K+ giving capacity
If spending $50-100K on education → Likely $25K+ giving capacity
If spending $25-50K on education → Likely $10K+ giving capacity
```

## Giving History Analysis

### Historical Giving Patterns

**Trend Analysis Formula:**

```
3-Year Giving Trend:
Year 1: $X
Year 2: $Y  
Year 3: $Z
Average Annual Growth Rate = ((Z/X)^(1/2) - 1) × 100

If positive trend > 20% annually → Upgrade ask by 50%
If stable (±10%) → Upgrade ask by 25%
If declining → Maintain or reduce ask
```

### Giving Capacity Utilization

```
Current Utilization = Actual Giving ÷ Estimated Capacity

Utilization Bands:
<1%: Significant untapped capacity (10x ask potential)
1-5%: Moderate capacity available (3-5x ask potential)
5-10%: Engaged donor (2x ask potential)
10-20%: Committed donor (1.5x ask potential)
>20%: Stretched donor (maintain current level)
```

### Frequency and Consistency Scoring

**Loyalty Score Calculation:**

```
Loyalty Score = (Years Given × 20) + (Gifts per Year × 15) + 
                (Average Gift Growth % × 10) + (Months Since Last Gift × -2)

Score Interpretation:
90+: Highly loyal - aggressive upgrade appropriate
70-89: Loyal - moderate upgrade recommended
50-69: Occasional - gentle upgrade possible
<50: Sporadic - focus on consistency first
```

### Multi-Year Pledge Analysis

**Pledge Capacity Formula:**

```
Multi-Year Capacity = Annual Capacity × Pledge Period × Confidence Factor

Confidence Factors:
3-year pledge: 0.9
5-year pledge: 0.7
7-year pledge: 0.5
10-year pledge: 0.3

Example:
$50K annual capacity × 5 years × 0.7 = $175K total pledge ask
```

## Peer Giving Benchmarks

### Peer Group Identification

**Peer Segmentation Variables:**
- Geographic location (zip code)
- Professional industry
- Age/life stage
- Wealth band
- Board service
- Social networks
- Education background
- Giving interests

### Peer Comparison Method

```
Peer Benchmark Ask = (Average of Top 3 Comparable Donors × 1.1)

Comparable Scoring:

Select peers with 6+ points for comparison
```

### Industry-Specific Benchmarks

**Giving by Professional Sector:**

| Industry | Typical % of Income | Typical % of Net Worth |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Finance/Banking | 1-3% | 0.5-1% |
| Technology | 0.5-2% | 0.3-0.8% |
| Healthcare | 1-2% | 0.4-0.8% |

| Inherited Wealth | 2-5% | 1-2% |
| Entertainment | 1-3% | 0.5-1.5% |

### Social Proof Influence

```
Social Network Effect:
Base Ask × Social Multiplier = Adjusted Ask

Social Multipliers:
Board member already gave more: 1.3x
Close friend gave at level: 1.2x
Business partner involved: 1.25x
Spouse on committee: 1.4x
Family tradition of giving: 1.5x
```

## Ask Ladder Construction

### Standard Ask Array Formula

**Three-Option Array:**

```
Option 1 (Stretch): Previous Gift × 3 OR Capacity × 0.1
Option 2 (Target): Previous Gift × 2 OR Capacity × 0.05
Option 3 (Floor): Previous Gift × 1.5 OR Capacity × 0.02

Example for $10K previous donor with $2M capacity:
Option 1: $30,000 (3x) or $200,000 (10%) → Present $30,000
Option 2: $20,000 (2x) or $100,000 (5%) → Present $20,000
Option 3: $15,000 (1.5x) or $40,000 (2%) → Present $15,000
```

### Five-Option Ladder

**Comprehensive Ask String:**

```
For donor with $5K last gift and $1M estimated capacity:

Visionary: $50,000 (10x previous, 5% capacity)
Leadership: $25,000 (5x previous, 2.5% capacity)  
Partner: $15,000 (3x previous, 1.5% capacity)
Sustainer: $10,000 (2x previous, 1% capacity)
Friend: $7,500 (1.5x previous, 0.75% capacity)
```

### Dynamic Ask Ladder Adjustments

**Positive Modifiers:**

| Factor | Adjustment |
|--------|------------|
| Attended gala in last year | +20% |
| Volunteered 20+ hours | +25% |
| Brought new donors | +30% |
| Increased giving 2 years straight | +35% |
| Spouse/family engaged | +40% |
| Expressed interest in program | +50% |

**Negative Modifiers:**

| Factor | Adjustment |
|--------|------------|
| Declined last 2 years | -30% |
| Recent job loss | -40% |
| Major purchase (home, tuition) | -25% |
| Health issues | -35% |
| Market downturn | -20% |
| Divorce/separation | -30% |

### Campaign vs. Annual Ask Arrays

**Campaign Ask Ladder:**

```
Campaign Multiplier = Annual Ask × 3-5 years

Leadership Ask: Annual Capacity × 5 × 0.5
Major Ask: Annual Capacity × 5 × 0.3
Special Ask: Annual Capacity × 5 × 0.2
Participation: Annual Capacity × 5 × 0.1

Example ($100K annual capacity):
Leadership: $250,000
Major: $150,000
Special: $100,000
Participation: $50,000
```

## Upgrade Formulas

### Standard Upgrade Calculation

```
Upgrade Ask = Current Giving × Upgrade Multiple × Confidence Factor

Upgrade Multiples by Tenure:
Year 1-2: 1.5x
Year 3-5: 1.3x
Year 5-10: 1.2x
Year 10+: 1.15x

Confidence Factors:
High engagement: 1.0
Medium engagement: 0.8
Low engagement: 0.6
```

### Graduated Upgrade Path

**Multi-Year Upgrade Strategy:**

```
Year 1 (Current): $1,000
Year 2 (Gentle): $1,500 (50% increase)
Year 3 (Moderate): $2,500 (67% increase)
Year 4 (Stretch): $5,000 (100% increase)
Year 5 (Leadership): $10,000 (100% increase)

Total 5-year value: $20,000 vs. $5,000 static
```

### Giving Society Upgrade Ladder

```
Entry Level ($1,000-2,499)
  ↓ (2.5x upgrade)
Bronze Level ($2,500-4,999)
  ↓ (2x upgrade)
Silver Level ($5,000-9,999)
  ↓ (2x upgrade)
Gold Level ($10,000-24,999)
  ↓ (2x upgrade)
Platinum Level ($25,000-49,999)
  ↓ (2x upgrade)
Diamond Level ($50,000+)
```

### Monthly Giving Conversion

```
Annual to Monthly Conversion:
Monthly Ask = (Annual Gift ÷ 12) × 1.2

Example:
$1,200 annual donor
Monthly ask = ($1,200 ÷ 12) × 1.2 = $120/month
Annual value = $1,440 (20% increase)
```

## Stretch Gift Strategies

### Stretch Gift Calculation

```
Stretch Capacity = Maximum Possible × Inspiration Factor × Timing Factor

Maximum Possible = Net Worth × 0.02 (annual) OR Net Worth × 0.10 (lifetime)
Inspiration Factor: 0.5-2.0 based on mission alignment
Timing Factor: 0.5-1.5 based on liquidity event

Example:
$10M net worth × 0.02 × 1.5 × 1.0 = $300,000 stretch annual ask
```

### Challenge and Matching Scenarios

**Match-Driven Stretch:**

```
Standard Capacity: $25,000
With 1:1 Match: Ask for $35,000 (40% stretch)
With 2:1 Match: Ask for $40,000 (60% stretch)
With 3:1 Match: Ask for $50,000 (100% stretch)

Rationale: Lower personal cost due to leverage
```

### Transformational Gift Opportunities

**Naming Rights Calculation:**

```
Naming Value = (Project Cost × 0.3-0.5) OR (Endowment × 0.5-1.0)

Examples:
$10M Building: $3-5M naming gift
$5M Program Endowment: $2.5-5M naming gift
$1M Scholarship Endowment: $500K-1M naming gift
```

### Once-in-Lifetime Asks

**Estate and Planned Gifts:**

```
Estate Percentage Ask:
Conservative: 5% of estate
Moderate: 10% of estate
Aggressive: 20% of estate
Transformational: 50%+ of estate

Calculation:
$20M estate × 10% = $2M bequest ask
Present Value (30 years, 5% discount): $463,000
Recognition Credit: Full $2M
```

## Specific Scenario Examples

### Scenario 1: First Ask to Event Attendee

**Prospect Profile:**
- Attended gala (bought $500 ticket)
- Net worth: $3M (verified)
- Age: 52
- Industry: Healthcare
- No prior giving history

**Calculation:**
```
Base Capacity: $3M × 0.03 = $90,000 annual
Event Engagement Factor: 0.1 (new relationship)
First Ask Discount: 0.5
Peer Benchmark: $15,000 (similar profiles)

Ask Ladder:
High: $15,000 (peer benchmark)
Target: $10,000 (comfortable stretch)
Low: $5,000 (double ticket price)

Recommended Ask: $10,000
```

### Scenario 2: Upgrading Loyal Annual Donor

**Donor Profile:**
- Current giving: $2,500/year for 5 years
- Net worth: $5M (estimated)
- Increasing pattern: 20% annually
- High engagement (volunteer, events)

**Calculation:**
```
Current Gift: $2,500
Loyalty Factor: 1.3 (5 years)
Growth Pattern: 1.2 (positive trend)
Engagement: 1.25 (highly engaged)
Capacity Check: $5M × 0.03 = $150,000 (room to grow)

Upgrade Ask: $2,500 × 1.3 × 1.2 × 1.25 = $4,875
Round to: $5,000

Ask Ladder:
Stretch: $7,500
Target: $5,000
Floor: $3,500
```

### Scenario 3: Campaign Ask to Major Donor

**Donor Profile:**
- Annual giving: $25,000/year
- Net worth: $15M
- Business owner (liquidity event pending)
- Board member spouse

**Calculation:**
```
Annual Capacity: $15M × 0.04 = $600,000
Campaign Capacity: $15M × 0.10 = $1,500,000
Current Utilization: $25,000/$600,000 = 4%
Liquidity Event Multiplier: 1.5
Board Connection: 1.3

Campaign Ask: $25,000 × 5 years × 8 (capacity multiple) × 1.5 × 1.3
= $1,950,000

Ask Ladder:
Visionary: $2,000,000 (naming opportunity)
Leadership: $1,000,000 (founder's circle)
Major: $500,000 (benefactor level)
Special: $250,000 (10x annual)
```

### Scenario 4: Planned Gift Conversation

**Prospect Profile:**
- Annual donor: $5,000/year
- Age: 72
- Net worth: $8M
- No children
- Passionate about mission

**Calculation:**
```
Estate Value: $8M
Charitable Interest: High (no heirs)
Age Factor: Immediate planning need
Current Giving: $5,000 (modest relative to wealth)

Planned Gift Options:
1. Bequest: 25% of estate ($2M)
2. Charitable Remainder Trust: $1M (income for life)
3. Gift Annuity: $500,000 (guaranteed income)
4. Outright Gift: $250,000 (immediate impact)

Recommended Approach:
Start with bequest conversation (25% = $2M)
Recognition at $2M level immediately
Continue annual giving separately
```
