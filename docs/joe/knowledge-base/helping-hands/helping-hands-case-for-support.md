# HELPING HANDS FOOD BANK
## Case for Support

### THE PROBLEM

**1 in 7 people in Greater Metro face hunger every day.**

That's 150,000 of our neighbors - including 45,000 children and 18,000 seniors - who don't know where their next meal will come from.

Despite living in a region of abundance:
- A minimum wage worker needs 82 hours of work to afford monthly groceries
- 35% of seniors choose between food and medicine
- 1 in 4 children only eat regular meals when school is in session
- Food costs have risen 40% while wages increased only 15%

**Hunger is hidden in our community.** It's the teacher buying snacks for students. The elderly neighbor whose Social Security doesn't stretch. The family choosing between rent and groceries.

### STORIES OF IMPACT

**Maria's Story:**
*"When my husband lost his job, we didn't know how we'd feed our three kids. Helping Hands not only provided groceries but treated us with dignity. Now I volunteer every week to give back. You saved our family during the hardest time."*

**James, Senior Client:**
*"The meal delivery means I can stay in my home instead of a nursing facility. But it's more than food - the volunteer who delivers is sometimes the only person I see all week. You're delivering connection along with nutrition."*

**Ms. Thompson, School Principal:**
*"The Kids Backpack Program changed everything. Our Monday tardiness dropped 40%. Behavioral issues nearly disappeared. When children aren't worried about food, they can focus on learning. You're feeding their futures."*

You have the power to change this.
