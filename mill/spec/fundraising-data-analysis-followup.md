# Fundraising Report Analysis Recipe

Transform fundraising reports into actionable intelligence with time-aware recommendations and data quality assessments.

## Workflow

This recipe analyzes a previously generated fundraising report (markdown format) to extract insights, validate data quality, and generate prioritized action items.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Context Validation

- Extract report date and period
- Determine current fiscal position (Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4)
- Identify time-sensitive opportunities
- Flag stale or irrelevant timeframes

### 2. Financial Performance Analysis

#### Extract Core Metrics

- Total revenue (current period)
- Revenue comparison (YoY, QoQ)
- Percentage change and direction
- Average gift size
- Total opportunities/donors

#### Calculate Derived Metrics

- Revenue per quarter/month
- Seasonal distribution patterns
- Donor concentration risk (top donor % of total)
- Pipeline velocity indicators

### 3. Pipeline Health Assessment

#### Opportunity Distribution

- Count by stage (Prospecting, Qualification, Cultivation, Solicitation, Pledged)
- Stage percentages and flow analysis
- Identify bottlenecks and gaps

#### Risk Indicators

- Pipeline size vs revenue target
- Stage concentration issues
- Conversion rate implications

### 4. Donor Segmentation Analysis

#### Segment Key Groups

- Major donors ($10K+) - count and impact
- Mid-level donors ($1K-$9.9K)
- Annual fund donors (<$1K)
- Recurring vs one-time donors

#### Retention Analysis

- Multi-year donor patterns
- Churn indicators
- Upgrade/downgrade trends

### 5. Seasonal & Trend Analysis

#### Revenue Timing

- Quarterly performance comparison
- Identify strongest/weakest periods
- Calculate seasonal variance
- Flag timing opportunities

#### Year-over-Year Trends

- Growth/decline patterns
- Trajectory analysis
- Benchmark comparisons

## Action Item Generation Rules

### Time-Sensitive Actions (Based on Current Date)

- **Q1:** Focus on sustaining momentum, planning Q2
- **Q2:** Address mid-year strategy, prepare summer campaigns
- **Q3:** Execute summer initiatives, prep year-end campaigns
- **Q4:** Maximize year-end giving, plan next year

### Priority Classification System

#### IMMEDIATE (This Week)

- Active solicitation opportunities
- Critical donor relationship risks
- Pipeline bottlenecks requiring intervention

#### SHORT-TERM (30 Days)

- Seasonal campaign execution
- Pipeline development activities
- Performance gap analysis

#### MEDIUM-TERM (90 Days)

- Strategic initiatives
- System improvements
- Capacity building

#### STRATEGIC (6+ Months)

- Program development
- Infrastructure changes
- Long-term growth planning

### Action Item Templates

#### Pipeline Actions

- "Contact [N] prospects in [Stage] - [specific action]"
- "Move [N] opportunities from [Stage A] to [Stage B]"
- "Close [N] active solicitations by [specific date]"

#### Revenue Actions

- "Execute [seasonal] campaign to address [specific gap]"
- "Increase [metric] from [current] to [target] by [method]"
- "Analyze [time period] performance to identify [specific issue]"

#### Risk Mitigation

- "Develop contingency for [specific risk] concentration"
- "Diversify [specific area] to reduce dependency"
- "Monitor [metric] with [frequency] reviews"

## Data Quality Assessment

### Required Validations

- Revenue figures reconcile across sections
- Percentages add up to 100%
- Date ranges are consistent
- Donor counts match opportunity counts

### Flag Missing Data

- Incomplete segmentation
- Missing historical comparisons
- Undefined metrics or calculations
- Vague estimates vs actual data

### Consistency Checks

- Narrative matches quantitative data
- Recommendations align with analysis
- Timeframes are realistic
- Resource requirements are specified

## Output Structure

### Executive Summary

- Key finding headlines (3-5 bullets)
- Primary recommendations
- Critical risk alerts

### Actionable Intelligence

- **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS** (Time-bound)
- **STRATEGIC PRIORITIES** (Impact-ranked)
- **INTELLIGENCE GAPS** (Data needs)
- **RISK MONITORING** (Warning indicators)

### Performance Benchmarks

- Current vs target metrics
- Trend indicators
- Comparative analysis

## Recipe Execution Checklist

### Pre-Analysis

- Validate input data completeness
- Establish current date context
- Identify analysis scope and limitations

### During Analysis

- Apply all framework sections systematically
- Cross-validate findings across sections
- Prioritize actions by impact and urgency

### Post-Analysis

- Review time-sensitivity of recommendations
- Ensure actionable specificity
- Validate mathematical accuracy
- Check for logical consistency

## Quality Control

- Would a fundraising professional understand these actions?
- Are the timeframes realistic given current date?
- Do the priorities make business sense?
- Are the missing data gaps clearly identified?

## Success Metrics for Recipe

- Actions are specific and immediately executable
- Timeframes align with business reality
- Critical risks are prominently flagged
- Data gaps are explicitly called out
- Recommendations are prioritized by impact
