# Sample Reports

This directory contains example reports that are committed to the repository for documentation purposes.

## Purpose

- Demonstrate report format and structure
- Provide examples for new contributors
- Show expected output from recipe executions
- **Note:** Contains sample/anonymized data only - no real donor information

## Structure

Each subdirectory represents a different Goose recipe:

```
reports-sample/
├── fundraising-data-analysis/
│   ├── report.md
│   └── metadata.json
└── other-recipe/
    ├── report.md
    └── metadata.json
```

## Working Reports

For actual generated reports from recipe runs, see the `reports/` directory (gitignored).
